Processing Sequencing Data.
----------------------------

Processing the sequencing data in separate runs.
 
(1) Technical Replicates

	Created groups for samples that can be processed separately. 

	Run each .sbatch file using associated Samples.txt files

(2) Without removing UMIs



(3) Index Hopping

	Created sample files with all possible combinations of N,S,F,R primers (96x96=9216 total samples). 
	
	Relevant lanes:
		070418_diagonal	- HiSeqX run with indices on the diagonal
		080618_NextSeq 	- NextSeq run with 96 samples (same library as 082818)
		082818_HiSeq	- HiSeqX run with 96 samples (same library as 080618)

	Created job array for each lane - submits 96 jobs (for each NS primer combo), each of which has a sample sheet with 96 samples (the F,R primers)




	Progress:
